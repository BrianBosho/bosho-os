# FedProp — Experimental Design (Locked Specification)

**From Literature Review to Committed Experimental Plan**

*Kipkirui & Barros, CMU Africa*

## 1. Executive Summary — What We Commit To

This document translates the literature review into a committed experimental plan. It locks four claims, six primary results, two appendix result sets, a dataset list, a baseline list, a hyperparameter table, and a reporting format.

**The commit:**

- 4 claims — A (zero-communication recovery), B (model-agnostic), C (partition robustness), D (heterophilic limitation).
- 6 main-paper results — 2 tables (R1 GCN, R1b GAT), 4 figures (R2–R5), 1 heterophilic table (R6).
- 4 appendix results — A1 Amazon, A2 PE ablation, A3 T sweep, A4 1-hop vs 2-hop.
- 8 datasets — 3 main (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) + 1 conditional (OGBN-Arxiv) + 2 appendix (Amazon ×2) + 2 limitation (Texas, Wisconsin).
- 6 primary baselines — Centralised, FedProp-Full, FedProp-Zero, FedProp (Adj), FedProp (Diff), FedGCN. FedGAT added for R1b.
- 3 positioning baselines — FedSage+, FedDEP, FedCog — cited in related work, NOT in the main accuracy table.
- Total committed runs — approximately 1,980 training runs across all experiments (see §4 run matrix).

> **COMMITMENT STATEMENT:** This plan is the source of truth. Anything not listed here is out of scope for v1 of the paper. If new experiments are proposed, they must either displace something here or be explicitly added as a scope change.

## 2. Claims and Supporting Experiments

Every experiment must trace back to one of the four claims.

| **Claim** | **Statement** | **Experiments that support it** | **Where it appears in paper** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **A** | Zero-additional-communication recovery of missing-neighbour performance. | R1 main accuracy table (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, OGBN-Arxiv), R2 accuracy-vs-communication plot, R3 recovery / gap-closed plot | Table 1 (main accuracy). Figure 1 (communication trade-off). Figure 2 (gap closed). Abstract + Introduction leads. |
| **B** | Model-agnosticity (works with GCN and GAT backbones). | R1b GAT variant of main accuracy table, FedProp-GAT vs FedGAT comparison | Table 2 (GAT results in main paper). Method description (§4). Explicit backbone-agnostic claim in contributions. |
| **C** | Robustness across partition severity (IID ↔ non-IID) and client count. | R4 IID vs non-IID sweep (β = 10000, 10, 1), R5 client-count scaling (K = 1, 5, 10, 20) | Figure 3 (β sweep). Figure 4 (K scaling). Discussion §5.3. |
| **D** | Homophily-dependent limitation on heterophilic graphs. | R6 Texas + Wisconsin heterophilic experiments, connected to 3-part error bound (T1/T2/T3) | Table 3 (heterophilic results). Limitations section §6. Theory discussion §3.4. |

## 4. Run Matrix — Total Training Runs

| **Result** | **Description** | **Datasets** | **Methods** | **Seeds** | **Settings** | **Total runs** | **Status** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **R1** | Core accuracy (GCN): IID + non-IID | 3 | 6 | 10 | 2 (β) | 360 | Cora/Cite/Pub: done. Re-run for consistency. |
| **R1 (OGBN)** | Core accuracy (GCN) on OGBN-Arxiv | 1 | 6 | 5 | 2 (β) | 60 | Conditional on gate |
| **R1b** | Core accuracy (GAT): IID + non-IID | 3 | 6 | 10 | 2 (β) | 360 | Partial; complete missing |
| **R2** | Accuracy-vs-comm. plot (re-uses R1 runs) | 2 | 5 | — | — | 0 new runs | Post-hoc from R1 |
| **R3** | Recovery bar plot (re-uses R1 runs) | 3 | 4 | — | — | 0 new runs | Post-hoc from R1 |
| **R4** | β sweep: 10000, 100, 10, 1 | 1 (Cora) | 4 | 10 | 4 (β) | 160 | Need to run |
| **R5** | K scaling: 1, 5, 10, 20 clients | 1 (Cora) | 3 | 10 | 4 (K) × 2 (β) | 240 | Partial; some from R1 already |
| **R6** | Heterophilic | 2 | 5 | 10 | 2 (β) | 200 | Need to run |
| **A1** | Amazon extended | 2 | 6 | 10 | 2 (β) | 240 | Mostly done; write-up needed |
| **A2** | PE ablation | 3 | 4 | 10 | 2 (β) | 240 | Have results; organise |
| **A3** | Prop. depth T sweep | 2 | 1 | 5 | 4 (T) | 40 | Need to run |

| | **TOTAL** | | | | | **≈ 1,980 training runs** | |

**Compute budget:** Cora/Citeseer/Pubmed runs take minutes each on a modern GPU. OGBN-Arxiv runs take approximately 20–30 minutes each. Rough total wall time with a single GPU: approximately 3–4 days from scratch. Many R1 and A1 runs are already complete or partially complete.

## 5. Hyperparameter Lock

| **Dataset** | **Backbone** | **Layers** | **Hidden** | **Dropout** | **Optim** | **LR** | **WD** | **Epochs / ES** | **Justification** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Cora** | GCN | 2 | 16 | 0.5 | SGD | 0.5 | 5e-4 | 600 max + ES patience 10 | Kipf & Welling; SGD/lr=0.5 from original codebase |
| **Cora** | GAT | 2 | 64 (8×8) | 0.6 | Adam | 0.005 | 5e-4 | 600 max + ES patience 10 | Velickovic et al. 2018 exact setting |
| **Citeseer** | GCN | 2 | 16 | 0.5 | SGD | 0.5 | 5e-4 | 600 max + ES patience 10 | Same as Cora (consistent w/ Planetoid family) |
| **Citeseer** | GAT | 2 | 64 (8×8) | 0.6 | Adam | 0.005 | 5e-4 | 600 max + ES patience 10 | Velickovic et al. 2018 |
| **Pubmed** | GCN | 2 | 16 | 0.5 | Adam | 0.01 | 5e-4 | 600 max + ES patience 10 | Kipf & Welling defaults; Adam works better on Pubmed scale |

**Federated protocol (applies to all datasets):**

- Number of clients: K = 10 (primary); R5 additionally sweeps K ∈ {1, 5, 10, 20} on Cora only.
- Aggregation: FedAvg, synchronous, weighted by client data size.
- Global rounds: 200 primary + early stopping on validation loss, patience 10.
- Local epochs per round: 1 (standard FedAvg).
- Partition: Dirichlet label distribution. β = 10,000 for IID; β = 10 for non-IID (primary). β = 100 and β = 1 added only for R4.
- FedProp propagation: T = 50 iterations. Diffusion step size h = 0.1. Boundary reset after each local iteration.
- Seeds: 10 random seeds per configuration. Mean ± standard deviation reported.

## 6. Dataset Lock

| **Dataset** | **Role** | **|V|/|E|** | **Split protocol** | **Partition protocol** | **Justification** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Cora** | **MAIN** | 2,708 / 5,429 | Planetoid fixed (20/class train, 500 val, 1000 test) | Dirichlet β=10000 (IID), β=10 (non-IID) | Standard benchmark. Matches FedGCN/FedGAT protocol exactly. Reviewers expect it. |
| **Citeseer** | **MAIN** | 3,327 / 4,732 | Planetoid fixed (120 train, 500 val, 1000 test) | Dirichlet β=10000, β=10 | Sparse adjacency stress test (avg deg 2.84 is smallest in set). |
| **Pubmed** | **MAIN** | 19,717 / 44,338 | Planetoid fixed (60 train, 500 val, 1000 test) | Dirichlet β=10000, β=10 | Larger-scale citation. Matches all primary baselines. |
| **OGBN-Arxiv** | **MAIN (conditional)** | 169,343 / 1.17M | OGB standard (~54% / 18% / 28%) | Dirichlet β=10000, β=10 | Scale differentiator vs FedSage+/FedCog. Gate conditions in §8. |
| **Amazon-Computers** | **APPENDIX** | 13,752 / 287K | Random 60/20/20 (10 seeds) | Dirichlet β=10000, β=10 | Already done. Extended validation beyond citation graphs. |

## 7. Baseline Lock

| **Method** | **Role** | **What it represents** | **Comparison protocol** | **Where it appears** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Centralised GCN/GAT** | Upper bound | Full graph access, no federation. Performance ceiling. | Same architecture and hyperparameters as federated variants. | R1, R1b, R3, R6. |
| **FedProp-Full (oracle)** | Upper bound | Federated but with exact 1-hop remote features available. | Same FedAvg + 10 clients + same HPs. | R1, R1b, R3, R6. |
| **FedProp-Zero** | Lower bound | Federated with no imputation. Remote neighbours are featureless. | Same FedAvg + 10 clients + same HPs. | R1, R1b, R3, R4, R5, R6. |
| **FedProp (Adj)** | Ablation | Our method with normalised-adjacency propagation (simpler variant). | T=50 iterations; no PE. | R1, R1b, A2 (with PE). |
| **FedProp (Diff)** | **OUR METHOD** | Our primary method. Discrete diffusion / heat-equation propagation. | T=50 iterations; h=0.1; no PE in main table. +PE variant in A2. | R1, R1b, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6. |
| **FedGCN (1-hop)** | Main competitor | Transmission-based baseline. Shares 1-hop features in pre-training. | Same HPs; report pre-training communication cost. | R1, R2, R4, R5, R6. |
| **FedGCN (2-hop)** | Main competitor | 2-hop feature exchange. | Same HPs. | R2 only. |
| **FedGAT** | Main competitor | GAT-specific transmission method. Chebyshev approximation. | Degree-16 Chebyshev. | R1b only. |
| **FedSage+** | Positioning (not in main table) | Different protocol family (Louvain + 60/20/20). | Cited in related work only. | Related work §2. |
| **FedDEP** | Positioning | Same family as FedSage+. | Cited in related work. | Related work §2. |
| **FedCog** | Positioning | Border-embedding sharing method. Dedicated contrast paragraph. | Cited. | Related work §2. §2.3 novelty comparison. |

**Cross-family disclaimer:** FedSage+, FedDEP, and FedCog will NOT appear in Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3 as numerical competitors. They belong to a different protocol family (Louvain + inductive 60/20/20). If a reviewer requests FedSage+ numbers, the response is: "Under the original FedSage+ protocol, results are in Appendix X; under our Dirichlet protocol, FedSage+ is out of scope because its generator training is not compatible with transductive fixed-split evaluation."

## 8. Decision Gates and Risk Management

### Gate 1 — OGBN-Arxiv inclusion in main paper

**Trigger:** FedProp (Diff) on OGBN-Arxiv completes with stable 10-seed results within 7 days of starting the run.

**If met:** Include OGBN-Arxiv as the 4th dataset in Table 1. Add to Figure 1 as the second subpanel.

**If not met:** Move OGBN-Arxiv to an appendix 'Scale discussion' section. Keep the main tables at 3 datasets. Do not let this delay submission.

### Gate 2 — GAT main table vs appendix

**Decision:** GAT (Table 2) goes in the MAIN paper. This is the cleanest way to support Claim B (model-agnosticity).

**Fallback:** If page count forces compression, the GAT table can move to appendix but the model-agnosticity claim must be downgraded from 'shown' to 'demonstrated in supplementary.'

### Gate 3 — Heterophilic results are worse than expected

**Expected outcome:** FedProp degrades on Texas/Wisconsin relative to FedProp-Full.

**If FedProp matches FedProp-Full on heterophilic:** Reframe around why propagation survives heterophily. Update Claim D to 'limited degradation.'

**If FedProp catastrophically fails:** Investigate numerically. Possible cause: diffusion step size h too aggressive. Try h ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. Report whichever h gives stable results.

## 9. Reporting Format — What Goes in the Paper

| **Paper element** | **Type** | **Content** | **Format** | **Source result(s)** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Table 1** | Table | Core GCN accuracy: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, OGBN-Arxiv × IID/non-IID × 6 methods | Mean ± std (3 decimal places). Bold best per column. | R1 + R1 (OGBN) |
| **Table 2** | Table | Core GAT accuracy: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed × IID/non-IID × 6 methods | Same format as Table 1. | R1b |
| **Table 3** | Table | Heterophilic: Texas + Wisconsin × IID/non-IID × 5 methods | Same format; add edge-homophily ratio as header row. | R6 |
| **Figure 1** | Figure | Accuracy (%) vs. total communication bytes (log scale) | Scatter plot; one colour per method; Cora + OGBN-Arxiv as subpanels. | R2 |
| **Figure 2** | Figure | Recovery bar plot: Zero → FedProp(Diff) → Full → Centralised | Grouped bars per dataset with % gap closed annotation. | R3 |
| **Figure 3** | Figure | Accuracy vs. β (Dirichlet partition severity) | Line plot on log-β axis; 4 methods; error bands = std over 10 seeds. | R4 |
| **Figure 4** | Figure | Accuracy vs. number of clients K | Line plot K ∈ {1,5,10,20}; 3 methods; two panels (IID, non-IID). | R5 |
| **Appx Table A1** | Table | Amazon-Computers + Amazon-Photos | Same format as Table 1. | A1 |
| **Appx Table A2** | Table | Positional encoding effect (Adj, Adj+PE, Diff, Diff+PE) | Delta from no-PE baseline as separate column. | A2 |
| **Appx Figure A3** | Figure | T sweep: accuracy vs. propagation iterations | Line plot; T ∈ {10, 25, 50, 100}. | A3 |
| **Appx Table A4** | Table | Accessible radius comparison (L=1 vs L=2) | Discuss privacy implications alongside accuracy. | A4 |

**Formatting conventions:**

- Accuracy reported as percentage with 1 decimal place in main text; 3 decimals (0.808 ± 0.014) in tables.
- Bold the best method per column. Highlight FedProp rows with a subtle background shade.
- Communication cost reported in MB per training session: 'pre-training' + 'per-round × rounds' = total.
- Every table/figure caption must state: dataset, partition (β), number of clients, number of seeds.
- Report gap closed = (FedProp − Zero) / (Full − Zero) × 100% in the recovery discussion.

## 10. Execution Priority

### Week 1 — Critical path

1. Finalise R1 on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed (10 seeds × IID/non-IID × all 6 methods). Lock numbers.
2. Start R1 OGBN-Arxiv runs. Kick off early because of Gate 1 timing.
3. Complete R1b GAT runs (any missing cells).

### Week 2 — Figures and extended

4. Run R4 β sweep (160 runs on Cora only — fast).
5. Run R5 K scaling (240 runs on Cora only — fast).
6. Produce Figures 1–4 from R1, R2, R3, R4, R5.
7. Finalise A1 Amazon write-up (runs already done).

### Week 3 — Limitation + appendix

8. Run R6 heterophilic (200 runs, fast — under 1 day total).
9. Run A3 T sweep + A4 1-hop/2-hop.
10. Organise A2 PE ablation from existing results.
11. Draft experimental section of paper using all locked numbers.
